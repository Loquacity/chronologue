# Chronologue Project
----------------
by [The Good Docs Project](thegooddocsproject.dev)

Chronologue is an open source calendrical toolkit for time travel, including various utilities for developers working on time travel technology, including but not limited to time-travel devices (“time machines”), farviewers, and other IoT (internet of time) or “time-tech” applications, to convert between calendrical systems.

Although the major calendrical systems (e.g. the Gregorian calendar, the Hijra calendar, Unix time) are adequate for most temporally-sequential use cases, they are not well-adapted for activities that involve traversing timestreams. Chronologue tools and libraries help developers convert between, among, and across traditional calendrical systems.

Chronologue includes:

* The Chronologue Time Standard (CTS), which provides consistent time coordinates across timelines
* Test suites for integrations or applications using the Chronologue Time Standard
* Tools for conversion between the Gregorian, Mayan, and Hijri calendars and the Chronologue Time Standard (CTS)

Please note: you are explicitly permitted to create closed-source conversion tools between the Chronologue Time Standard and proprietary calendars (for example, Swatch Internet Time, also known as ‘[.beat time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time)’).
